# About the Project

This Projects converts integer value to roman number. It does not use any built in library.
Written in Python3.

### Project assumes following
1. There is only one correct way to represent a particular number as a Roman numeral.
2. The converse is also true: if a string of characters is a valid Roman numeral, it represents only one number (that is, it can only be interpreted one way).
3. There is a limited range of numbers that can be expressed as Roman numerals, specifically 1 through 3999. The Romans did have several ways of expressing larger numbers, for instance by having a bar over a numeral to represent that its normal value should be multiplied by 1000. For the purposes of this project, letâ€™s stipulate that Roman numerals go from 1 to 3999.
4. There is no way to represent 0 in Roman numerals.
5. There is no way to represent negative numbers in Roman numerals.
6. There is no way to represent fractions or non-integer numbers in Roman numerals.

### How to Run
Python3 should be installed in your system. You can run this by simply executing the python file.
```
./roman.py
 ```
 
### Unit tests
Unit tests covered all above assumptions. Tests can be called by executing test file.
```
./roman_unit_test.py
```
